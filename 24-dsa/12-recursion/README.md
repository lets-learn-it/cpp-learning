# Recursion

- Recursion is heavily used in tree, graph, DP, backtracking etc.
- We try to make input small. Actually we take a **decision which makes input smaller**.
- recursion is needed when there are **choices and decisions** present.
- Understanding recursion tree is very important. Below is recursion tree of subset problem.
