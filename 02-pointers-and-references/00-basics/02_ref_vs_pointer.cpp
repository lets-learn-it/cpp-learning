 *
 * 1. pointer can be reassigned, reference cannot. references must be bound at initialization.
 * 2. A pointer variable has its own identity: a distinct, visible memory address.
 *    the referenceâ€™s own address and size are invisible. Since the reference assumes the identity of
 *    the original variable in this way, it is convenient to think of a reference as another name
 *    for the same variable
 * 3. It is possible to create a pointer to a pointer, but not a pointer to a reference.
 * 4. A pointer can be assigned nullptr, whereas a reference must be bound to an existing object.
 * 5. A pointer needs to be dereferenced with * to access the object it points to, whereas a reference can be used directly. A pointer to a class/struct uses -> to access its members whereas a reference uses a .
