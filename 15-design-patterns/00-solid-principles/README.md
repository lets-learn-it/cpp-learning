# Solid Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle

- Class or method should have only one responsibiltu and only one reason to change

## Open Closed Principle

- Class or module should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that it should be possible to add new functionality to the system without having to modify existing code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

- Any object or instance of a subtype/subclass should be able to be used in place of an instance of its base type/class without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle

- No code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Means that we should break larger interfaces into smaller ones. (class should not be forced to implement interfaces that it does not use)

## Dependency Inversion Principle

- High level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. In simple words, high level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
